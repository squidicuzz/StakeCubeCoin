What is StakeCubeCoin (SCC)?
-------------------------

StakeCubeCoin is a fork of the Dash codebase; which uses a combination of FiroPow-PoW and Deterministic Masternodes to secure the cryptocurrency's network and blockchain.

The StakeCubeCoin blockchain is further secured by Masternodes, which enforce ChainLocks and InstantSend for a high-speed, secure network monitored by 1000s of Masternodes, constantly producing secure quorums.

The first consecutive blocks contain the coins allocated for the user coin swap (From the MUE codebase), destined for holders of the previous PoS/MN version of StakeCubeCoin.

7.5 million (7,500,000) SCC was reserved in the first mined block for swapping user coins.

A total of 1,000 SCC is required to run a masternode;
